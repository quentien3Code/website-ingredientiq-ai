## About IngredientIQ

IngredientIQ™ provides decision support at the point of purchase using a **hybrid architecture**:

1. **Human-Centered Core**: Deterministic, rule-based logic drives all decision support
2. **ML Inputs**: Machine Learning provides precision risk/confidence scores as data
3. **AI Output**: AI translates complex findings into plain-language explanations at the shelf
